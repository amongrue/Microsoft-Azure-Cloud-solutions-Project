# Microsoft-Azure-Cloud-solutions-Project
Building A secure Network Design Infrasturcture Project (Azure, Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform GCP)
<h1>Microsoft-Azure-Cloud-Solutions-Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a simple Microsoft Azure that walks the user through configured my Hybrid cloud environment with Microsoft Azure by creating resource groups for three departments, using IAM system as a prerequisite for my Role base access control (RBAC)-principleof least privilege. Establishing a key ðŸ”‘ vault for each department, also creating a recovery service backup vaults for my key ðŸ”‘ vaults - adding RPO& RTO, and more. 
I also configured and encrypted my network settings, encrypted data at rest, and intransite. Lastly, I did a presentation, including the shared responsibilities factors for vendors, clients, customers, etc. .
